# Finding-the-Best-Markets-to-Advertise-In

For this project, we will assume to be working for an e-learning company that offers online courses on programming. Most courses focus on web and mobile development, while some others cover data science, game development, etc. 

### Data

Since conducting surveys can be quite cost expensive, we are using data from a survey by another e-learning company. The data set of this project contains information about a survey from freeCodeCamp's from the year 2017. An artice about the survey can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969/). The survey data was published on [GitHub](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey).

## Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to identify the best two markets to advertise our project online. Therefore, we need to know about the following characteristics of potential new coders:
- Where are the new coders located
- What are the locations with the greatest number of new coders
- How much money are new coders willing to spend on learning
